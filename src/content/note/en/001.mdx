Welcome to my blog!

After half a day of struggling, I finally got this blog up and running 😭

This blog was built using the [Astro](https://astro.build/) framework and the [Thought Lite](https://github.com/tuyuritio/astro-theme-thought-lite) theme.

It is deployed using EdgeOne Pages.

The general process is as follows:

### Clone the Repository

Log in to your Github account, open [tuyuritio/astro-theme-thought-lite](https://github.com/tuyuritio/astro-theme-thought-lite), click the Fork button in the upper right corner to clone the repository to your own account.

Copy the repository address, open the terminal, and use the `git clone` command to clone the repository locally.

### Install Dependencies

Open the terminal in the project directory.

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Local Debugging Commands

| Command      | Action                                                                 |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| pnpm i       | Install dependencies                                                   |
| pnpm dev     | Start the local development server at localhost:4321                   |
| pnpm build   | Build your production site to ./dist/                                  |
| pnpm preview | Preview your build locally before deployment                           |
| pnpm format  | Format code using Prettier                                             |

### Configuration Items

Thought Lite's configuration is stored in `site.config.ts`.

The following is an example configuration from the Thought Lite Github:

```typescript
- `title` - Site title
- `prologue` - Homepage tagline, supports `\n` line breaks
- `author`
    - **string** - Author name
    - **object**
        - `name` - Author name
        - `email` - Author email
        - `link` - Author personal website
- `description` - Site description

        - **`*`** - All sections
        - **array**
            - `note` - Note section

    - `limit` - Content quantity limit
- `latest` - Latest content display
    - `note` - Whether to display latest note

```

### EdgeOne Pages Deployment

In the EdgeOne Pages interface, select Import Github repository and choose the Thought Lite template repository you forked earlier.

The remaining configuration will be automatically recognized by EdgeOne as Astro, so just click Start Deployment and it's done 👌.

After deployment is complete, you can enter the Pages management page to configure functions such as binding a domain name.
