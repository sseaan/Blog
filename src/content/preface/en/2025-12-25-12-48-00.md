I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately... I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life. — Thoreau
This textual wilderness is built for this very purpose, and what is recorded here are some attempts and imaginations.
Documenting those moments that prompted my change might also bring a breeze of change to you.
