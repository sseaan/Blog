## About This Place

This is my personal blog.  
I write about tinkering with things and daily life; I record my thoughts and harbor my emotions.  
It may not be noisy, but it will always be lit.

If you too take your words and time seriously,  
welcome to exchange a link with me,  
letting two lamps gaze at each other from their distant shores.

Please read the instructions below briefly before applying.

## Agreements for Links

To keep the chain of links looking neat and quiet on the page, and for easier maintenance in the future, here are a few small agreements:

- **Regarding Nicknames**  
  To maintain a consistent overall style, if a nickname contains structures like "Blog," "XX's XX," or "XX's Blog," it may be moderately simplified.  
  If you wish to keep it as is, please make a note in your application.

- **Regarding Broken Links**  
  If your blog is left unattended for a long period, it will be placed in a lost-and-found list.  
  If you wish to be added back, please leave a comment below.

- **Regarding Link Review**  
  As I am a high school senior about to take the college entrance examination, I have very little time, so I can only review during holidays.  
  (And my school is an outrageous entity that decides holidays as it pleases.)

## Link Application Requirements

There are no overly complex barriers; I simply hope that we are all genuinely present:

1. The site's content must be legal and positive, and must not contain content that violates mainland Chinese laws and regulations.  
2. The website must be accessible normally from mainland China.  
3. Please add a link to this site on your site first, then leave a comment below to apply.
4. Maintain your blog regularly.
