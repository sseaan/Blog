Hello, I am **Sean**!
On the internet, I often use the variations **Sean** and **Sseaan**.

I am a high school senior from Guangzhou currently preparing for the college entrance exam.
I enjoy playing Zenless Zone Zero, Identity V, Minecraft, Overcooked, and indie offline games...

I maintain a curiosity for novel things, so I record my thoughts and reflections from daily life, as well as problems and solutions encountered during my tinkering, here.
